<h1 class="title">From The Deep</h1>

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

<h2 class="title"> Pages of The Necronomicon for Shadow of the Demon Lord </h2>

From the vast and unknown oceans come the Deep Ones. Living in ancient underwater cities like Y'ha-nthlei and it is said that they are descended from the ancient gods Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. Some even whispers of Deep Ones devoted to the High-Priest of the Great Old One, Great Cthulhu, who dreams in his sunken city of R'lyeh.

No-one is entirely sure where Deep Ones come from or why they are able to breed with any living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, but they all agree that these amphibian humanoids are themselves immortal.

## Deep One Hybrids

When Deep Ones breed with other creatures, the result is a Deep One hybrid. Hybrids are born normally and grow just like their main ancestry, but as they age they slowly turn more and more into a Deep One until they are fully Deep Ones and move to live below water for all eternity.

#### Great Cthulhu

*"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"*<br />
In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming

At the deepest point of the ocean lays the city of R'lyeh, where it sank during time immemorial as Great Cthulhu and his Spawn fought against the Old Ones and their Shoggoth soldiers. 

Among those who dwell in the ocean, many have seen Great Cthulhu in their dreams and there are those among them who have tried to communicate with him through these dreams. Many have gone irreparably mad, but those who did not became the High Priests of Great Cthulhu, devoted to get everyone ready for when the stars are right once again, and Great Cthulhu stirs in his sunken city of R'lyeh. 

Those who practice the religion have access to the traditions of Divination, Madness, and Water.

#### Deep One Hybrids and Corruption

Although not entirely exempt from the effects of corruption, it affects Deep One hybrids a bit differently. Use the table below to determine the effect of each corruption point they gain.

As the hybrid gains corruption, they gain Deep One traits which in turn evolve them ever closer to becoming a full-fledged Deep One. If a hybrid ever has a total corruption score of 9+ they will have the dream and start turning into a Deep One. Every time the hybrid completes a rest, they need to roll a d20 minus any corruption above 9. On a natural 1 or a total of 0 or below, the hybrid will wake up completely metamorphosed into a Deep One and immediately start their trip to the nearest Deep One underwater habitat, where they will spend the rest of eternity. 

The character becomes an NPC at this point.

### Deep One Hybrid Characters

Use the following rules to create your own Deep One hybrid characters. Add any benefits from paths you choose to these benefits to create more powerful Deep Ones, there are some sample Deep One hybrid and Deep One characters at the end of this supplement. 

At your GM's discretion, these rules can also be used to create Deep One player characters, but keep in mind that all Deep One hybrids become full fledged Deep Ones eventually.

#### Starting Ancestry

Deep Ones can breed with living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, as long as their not created by magic-so no vampires, clockworks, changelings, et al.

Create your character according to your base ancestry first, then apply the following adjustments, traits, and talents to the character.

Since all Deep One hybrids are born that way, only starting characters can ever become a Deep One hybrid.


<h4 class="traits">Creating a Deep One Hybrid</h4>

- **Attribute Scores** Increase Strength by 1 and decrease Intellect by 1
- **Characteristics** Increase Perception by 1. Gain 1d3 Insanity and 1 Corruption. Reduce Speed by 2.
- **Shadowsight** The Deep One can see into areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.
- **Hold Breath** Deep One hybrids can hold their breath under water for up to 1 hour.
- **The Call of Dagon** Whenever a Deep One hybrid gains corruption so their total is an even number, their transformation into a full-fledged Deep One gets ever so closer. Randomly determine 1 trait from the Deep One traits list.

<h4 class="traits">Level 4 Deep One Expert</h4>

- **Characteristics** As your base ancestry.
- You either learn one spell, gain the level 4 benefit from your ancestry, or choose 1 trait from the Deep One traits list.

## New Disease

Some Deep Ones can infect their victims with their bite.

### Dagon's Mind Rot

When a Deep One bites you, there is a chance you will get diseased. Deep Ones and Deep One hybrids are immune to this disease, but everyone else must make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes or get infected. Each time an infected creature completes a rest, it must make a new Strength challenge roll, on a failure, it gains 1d3 Insanity. 

Whenever an infected creature goes mad, it becomes a mindless thrall to whichever Deep One infected them and becomes compelled to seek it out and do its bidding. After three successes, the creature removes the diseased affliction.

## Sample Deep Ones and Hybrids

Here you will find a diverse selection of Deep One and Hybrid characters for use in adventures you create. 

### Deep One

When a Deep One hybrid reaches a certain age, typically between 35 and 45, they have a particular dream of great underwater cities and their inhabitants, the Deep Ones. The dream usually culminates in the hybrid being accepted among their ranks by Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. When they awake from this dream, the hybrid's metamorphosis into a Deep One accelerates considerably and have typically evolved into a full-fledged Deep One by the end of the next fortnight.

### Deep One Priests

Most Deep Ones worship Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, whom the learned among them teach are the first Deep Ones since time immemorial. But even above them stands their mightiest god, the Great Old One, Cthulhu, who lay dreaming in his sunken city of R'lyeh. Among the Deep Ones, some are chosen by the Great Cthulhu, through dreams, to make sure the Deep Ones stay loyal to the God until that time when the stars are right and the Great Cthulhu stirs in his sleep and primordial R'lyeh rises to the surface once again.
