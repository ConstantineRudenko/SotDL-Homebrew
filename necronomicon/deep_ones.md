# Deep Ones

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

## Pages of The Necronomicon for 
## Shadow of the Demon Lord

From the vast and unknown oceans come the Deep Ones. Living in ancient underwater cities like Y'ha-nthlei and it is said that they are descended from the ancient gods Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. Some even whispers of Deep Ones devoted to the High-Priest of the Great Old One, Great Cthulhu, who dreams in his sunken city of R'lyeh.

No-one is entirely sure where Deep Ones come from or why they are able to breed with any living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, but they all agree that these amphibian humanoids are themselves immortal.

#### Deep One Hybrid Characters

Use the following rules to create your own Deep One hybrid characters. Add any benefits from paths you choose to these benefits to create more powerful Deep Ones, there are some sample Deep One hybrid and Deep One characters at the end of this supplement. 

At your GM's discretion, these rules can also be used to create Deep One player characters, but keep in mind that all Deep One hybrids become full fledged Deep Ones eventually.

##### Great Cthulhu

*"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"*

In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming-At the deepest point of the ocean lays the city of R'lyeh, where it sank during time immemorial as Great Cthulhu and his Spawn fought against the Old Ones and their Shoggoth soldiers. 

Among those who dwell in the ocean, many have seen Great Cthulhu in their dreams and there are those among them who have tried to communicate with him through these dreams. Many have gone irreparably mad, but those who did not became the High Priests of Great Cthulhu, devoted to get everyone ready for when the stars are right once again, and Great Cthulhu stirs in his sunken city of R'lyeh. 

Those who practice the religion have access to the traditions of Divination, Madness, and Water.

##### Starting Ancestry

Deep Ones can breed with living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, as long as their not created by magic-so no vampires, clockworks, changelings, et al.

Create your character according to your base ancestry first, then apply the following adjustments, traits, and talents to the character.

Among the Deep Ones, some are chosen by the Great Cthulhu, through dreams, to make sure the Deep Ones stay loyal to the God until that time when the stars are right and the Great Cthulhu stirs in his sleep and primordial R'lyeh rises to the surface once again.
