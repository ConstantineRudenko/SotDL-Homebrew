#### Deep One Hybrid Characters

Use the following rules to create your own Deep One characters. At your GM's discretion, these rules can also be used to create Deep One player characters, but keep in mind that all Deep One hybrids become full fledged Deep Ones eventually.

##### Starting Ancestry

Deep Ones can breed with living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, as long as their not created by magic-so no vampires, clockworks, or changelings, et al.
Create your character according to your base ancestry first, then apply the following adjustments, traits, and talents to the character.
Since all Deep One hybrids are born that way, only starting characters can ever become a Deep One hybrid.

##### Deep One Traits

- **Attribute Scores** Increase Strength by 1 and decrease Intellect by 1
- **Characteristics** Increase Perception by 1. Gain 1d3 Insanity and 1 Corruption. Reduce Speed by 2.
- **Shadowsight** The Deep One can see into areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.
- **Hold Breath** Deep One hybrids can hold their breath under water for up to 1 hour.
- **Dark Devotion** Deep One hybrids have been dreaming of the Deep Ones watery homes and their gods, Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. This has made them somewhat hardier against being charmed or frightened. Gain 1 boon on all challenge rolls against being charmed or frightened.
- **The Call of Dagon** Whenever a Deep One hybrid gains corruption so their total is an even number, their transformation into a full-fledged Deep One gets ever so closer. Randomly determine 1 trait from the Deep One list below.

##### Level 4 Deep One Expert

- **Characteristics** As your base ancestry.
You either learn one spell, gain the level 4 benefit from your ancestry, or choose 1 trait from the Deep One list below.

##### Deep One Traits

| 3D6 | Deep One Trait |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | **Amphibious** You can now survive equally well in water or on land. You gain a swimming speed of 12. |
| 2  | **Deep Dweller** You gain 1 boon on any Challenge rolls related to swimming. And can never be harmed by water pressure. |
| 3 | **Claws** One or both of your hands morph into claws or pincers, you can now use them as natural weapons that function as basic weapons with the finesse property and deal 1d6 damage. |
| 4 | **Calling of the Deep** Every week you spend more than 10 miles (15 km) from the sea, you must succeed on a Will Challenge Roll or reduce Will by 1 until next time you're able to touch a large body of sea water. |
| 5 | 4 or lower |
| 6 | 4 or lower |
