<h1 class="title"><span>From The Deep</span></h1>

<h2 class="title"> Pages of The Necronomicon for Shadow of the Demon Lord </h2>

Among the many tales told by old fishwives, some tell of sacrifices to the sea which will provide riches untold. Some say that the sacrifice must be made in gold, others in blood, but the reality is much, much darker.

From the abyss of the deep ocean, come the Deep Ones. It is true that they provide riches untold, and even immortality. But the sacrifice, if it can even be called such, is a mating with the Deep One, where the progeny will indeed be gifted with immortality.

Immortality comes with a price, of course. For one day, such a hybrid will, without fail, metamorphose into a Deep One and be compelled to dive into the deep to live with the Deep Ones in their cyclopean cities, till Great Cthulhu awakens.

## Deep One Hybrids

Deep Ones, for reasons unknown, are able to breed with any living creatures. The progeny, if born of a female that is not already a Deep One, are born as a normal child and even grow and age normally. 

But as they age they slowly manifest strange features, like folded skin on their necks resembling gills, or bulging unblinking eyes. And when the time is right, such a progeny will metamorphose wholly into a Deep One and must thenceforth live below water for all eternity.

### Great Cthulhu

*Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn* <br />
In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.<br /><br />

At the deepest point of the ocean lays the great city of R'lyeh, where it sank during time immemorial when Great Cthulhu and his Spawn fought against the Old Ones and the Shoggoths.

There Great Cthulhu lays dreaming and his dreams can, and will, bleed into the dreams of others. Showing them sights that would make even the strongest turn to madness, for such things that they see cannot and must not be real.

Even among the Deep Ones, many have chosen madness, but there are those who did not, and who became Great Cthulhu's High Priests. Devoting their eternity to Cthulhu, preparing for that day when when the stars are finally right once again, and Great Cthulhu will stir in his sunken city of R'lyeh. 

Those who practice the religion have access to the traditions of Divination, Madness, and Water.

### Deep One Hybrids and Corruption

Although not entirely exempt from the effects of corruption, it affects Deep One hybrids a bit differently. Use the table below to determine the effect of each corruption point they gain.

As the hybrid gains corruption, they gain Deep One traits which in turn evolve them ever closer to becoming a full-fledged Deep One. If a hybrid ever has a total corruption score of 9+ they will have the dream and start turning into a Deep One. Every time the hybrid completes a rest, they need to roll a d20 minus any corruption above 9. On a natural 1 or a total of 0 or below, the hybrid will wake up completely metamorphosed into a Deep One and immediately start their trip to the nearest Deep One underwater habitat, where they will spend the rest of eternity. 

The character becomes an NPC at this point.

<h4 class="table">Corruption Effects</h4>

### Deep One Hybrid Characters

Use the following rules to create your own Deep One hybrid characters. Add any benefits from paths you choose to these benefits to create more powerful Deep Ones, there are some sample Deep One hybrid and Deep One characters at the end of this supplement. 

At your GM's discretion, these rules can also be used to create Deep One player characters, but keep in mind that all Deep One hybrids become full fledged Deep Ones eventually.

#### Starting Ancestry

Deep Ones can breed with living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, as long as their not created by magic-so no vampires, clockworks, changelings, et al.

Create your character according to your base ancestry first, then apply the following adjustments, traits, and talents to the character.

Since all Deep One hybrids are born that way, only starting characters can ever become a Deep One hybrid.


<h4 class="traits">Creating a Deep One Hybrid</h4>

- **Attribute Scores** Increase Strength by 1 and decrease Intellect by 1
- **Characteristics** Increase Perception by 1. Gain 1d3 Insanity and 1 Corruption. Reduce Speed by 2.
- **Shadowsight** The Deep One can see into areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.
- **Hold Breath** Deep One hybrids can hold their breath under water for up to 1 hour.
- **The Call of Dagon** Whenever a Deep One hybrid gains corruption so their total is an even number, their transformation into a full-fledged Deep One gets ever so closer. Randomly determine 1 trait from the Deep One traits list.

<h4 class="traits">Level 4 Deep One Expert</h4>

- **Characteristics** As your base ancestry.
- You either learn one spell, gain the level 4 benefit from your ancestry, or choose 1 trait from the Deep One traits list.

### New Disease

Some Deep Ones can infect their victims with their bite.

#### Dagon's Mind Rot

When a Deep One bites you, there is a chance you will get diseased. Deep Ones and Deep One hybrids are immune to this disease, but everyone else must make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes or get infected. Each time an infected creature completes a rest, it must make a new Strength challenge roll, on a failure, it gains 1d3 Insanity. 

Whenever an infected creature goes mad, it becomes a mindless thrall to whichever Deep One infected them and becomes compelled to seek it out and do its bidding. After three successes, the creature removes the diseased affliction.

### New Spells

The following spells expand on those presented in other materials for *Shadow of the Demon Lord*

<div class="spell">

</div>

```
```

## Sample Deep Ones and Hybrids

Here you will find a diverse selection of Deep One and Hybrid characters for use in adventures you create. 

### Deep One

When a Deep One hybrid reaches a certain age, typically between 35 and 45, they have a particular dream of great underwater cities and their inhabitants, the Deep Ones. The dream usually culminates in the hybrid being accepted among their ranks by Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. When they awake from this dream, the hybrid's metamorphosis into a Deep One accelerates considerably and have typically evolved into a full-fledged Deep One by the end of the next fortnight.

### Deep One Priests

Most Deep Ones worship Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, whom the learned among them teach are the first Deep Ones since time immemorial. But above all, stand their mightiest god, the Great Old One, Cthulhu, who wandered the world aeons before even the First People.

Among the Deep Ones, there are those who count themselves as chosen through dreams by the great priest Cthulhu. Tasked with preparing the Deep Ones for that day when the stars are ready, and great Cthulhu will stir in his sleep as the mighty city of R'lyeh rises to the surface once again.
