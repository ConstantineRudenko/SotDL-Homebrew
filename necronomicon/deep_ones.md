# Deep Ones

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

## Pages of The Necronomicon for 
## Shadow of the Demon Lord

From the vast and unknown oceans come the Deep Ones. Living in ancient underwater cities like Y'ha-nthlei and it is said that they are descended from the ancient gods Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. Some even whispers of Deep Ones devoted to the High-Priest of the Great Old One, Great Cthulhu, who dreams in his sunken city of R'lyeh.

No-one is entirely sure where Deep Ones come from or why they are able to breed with any living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, but they all agree that these amphibian humanoids are themselves immortal.

#### Deep One Hybrid Characters

Use the following rules to create your own Deep One hybrid characters. Add any benefits from paths you choose to these benefits to create more powerful Deep Ones, there are some sample Deep One hybrid and Deep One characters at the end of this supplement. 

At your GM's discretion, these rules can also be used to create Deep One player characters, but keep in mind that all Deep One hybrids become full fledged Deep Ones eventually.

##### Great Cthulhu

*"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"*
In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming

At the deepest point of the ocean lays the city of R'lyeh, where it sank during time immemorial as Great Cthulhu and his Spawn fought against the Old Ones and their Shoggoth soldiers. 

Among those who dwell in the ocean, many have seen Great Cthulhu in their dreams and there are those among them who have tried to communicate with him through these dreams. Many have gone irreparably mad, but those who did not became the High Priests of Great Cthulhu, devoted to get everyone ready for when the stars are right once again, and Great Cthulhu stirs in his sunken city of R'lyeh. 

Those who practice the religion have access to the traditions of Divination, Madness, and Water.

##### Starting Ancestry

Deep Ones can breed with living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, as long as their not created by magic-so no vampires, clockworks, changelings, et al.

Create your character according to your base ancestry first, then apply the following adjustments, traits, and talents to the character.

Since all Deep One hybrids are born that way, only starting characters can ever become a Deep One hybrid.

##### Creating a Deep One Hybrid

- **Attribute Scores** Increase Strength by 1 and decrease Intellect by 1
- **Characteristics** Increase Perception by 1. Gain 1d3 Insanity and 1 Corruption. Reduce Speed by 2.
- **Shadowsight** The Deep One can see into areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.
- **Hold Breath** Deep One hybrids can hold their breath under water for up to 1 hour.
- **The Call of Dagon** Whenever a Deep One hybrid gains corruption so their total is an even number, their transformation into a full-fledged Deep One gets ever so closer. Randomly determine 1 trait from the Deep One list below.

##### Level 4 Deep One Expert

- **Characteristics** As your base ancestry.
- You either learn one spell, gain the level 4 benefit from your ancestry, or choose 1 trait from the Deep One list below.

#### New Disease - Dagon's Mind Rot

When a Deep One bites you, there is a chance you will get diseased. Deep Ones and Deep One hybrids are immune to this disease, but everyone else must make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes or get infected. Each time an infected creature completes a rest, it must make a new Strength challenge roll. On a failure, it takes a -1 penalty to Will. If this penalty reduces its Will to 0, the creature becomes a mindless thrall to whichever Deep One infected them and will automatically seek it out to its bidding. After three successes, the creature removes the diseased affliciton; and the next time it completes a rest, the reduction to Will ends.

##### Deep One Priests

Most Deep Ones worship Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, whom the learned among them teach are the first Deep Ones since time immemorial. But even above them stands their mightiest god, the Great Old One, Cthulhu, who lay dreaming in his sunken city of R'lyeh. Among the Deep Ones, some are chosen by the Great Cthulhu, through dreams, to make sure the Deep Ones stay loyal to the God until that time when the stars are right and the Great Cthulhu stirs in his sleep and primordial R'lyeh rises to the surface once again.
