# Deep Ones

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

## Pages of The Necronomicon for 
## Shadow of the Demon Lord

From the vast and unknown oceans come the Deep Ones. Living in ancient underwater cities like Y'ha-nthlei and it is said that they are descended from the ancient gods Father Dagon and Mother Hydra. Some even whispers of Deep Ones devoted to the High-Priest of the Great Old One, Great Cthulhu, who dreams in his sunken city of R'lyeh.

No-one is entirely sure where Deep Ones come from or why they are able to breed with any living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, but they all agree that these amphibian humanoids are themselves immortal.

#### Deep One Hybrid Characters

Use the following rules to create your own Deep One hybrid characters. Add any benefits from paths you choose to these benefits to create more powerful Deep Ones, there are some sample Deep One hybrid and Deep One characters at the end of this supplement. 

At your GM's discretion, these rules can also be used to create Deep One player characters, but keep in mind that all Deep One hybrids become full fledged Deep Ones eventually.

##### Starting Ancestry

Deep Ones can breed with living creatures, mortals and immortals alike, as long as their not created by magic-so no vampires, clockworks, changelings, et al.

Create your character according to your base ancestry first, then apply the following adjustments, traits, and talents to the character.

Since all Deep One hybrids are born that way, only starting characters can ever become a Deep One hybrid.

##### Creating a Deep One Hybrid

- **Attribute Scores** Increase Strength by 1 and decrease Intellect by 1
- **Characteristics** Increase Perception by 1. Gain 1d3 Insanity and 1 Corruption. Reduce Speed by 2.
- **Shadowsight** The Deep One can see into areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.
- **Hold Breath** Deep One hybrids can hold their breath under water for up to 1 hour.
- **The Call of Dagon** Whenever a Deep One hybrid gains corruption so their total is an even number, their transformation into a full-fledged Deep One gets ever so closer. Randomly determine 1 trait from the Deep One list below.

##### Level 4 Deep One Expert

- **Characteristics** As your base ancestry.
You either learn one spell, gain the level 4 benefit from your ancestry, or choose 1 trait from the Deep One list below.

```
